A combination of Host Files I gathered from different sources.  The Disconnect Host Files were not in hosts format so I downloaded them and converted. The Easy List Sophos Malware Hosts were also not in hosts format.  The SpyBot Anti-Beacon I purchased and had the program add the hosts to my windows host file, then pulled from there to add to this list.  Finally the Nvidia Hosts took hours and hours of scrubbing the internet for different sources and combining the ones that worked.
